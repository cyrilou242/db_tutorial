As a data engineer, I use relational databases every day at my job, but they're a black box to me. Some questions I have:
- What format is data saved in? (in memory and on disk)
- When does it move from memory to disk?
- Why can there only be one primary key per table?
- How does rolling back a transaction work?
- How are indexes formatted?
- When and how does a full table scan happen?
- What format is a prepared statement saved in?

In other words, how does a database **work**?

To figure things out, I'm writing a database from scratch. It's modeled off sqlite because it is designed to be small with fewer features than MySQL or PostgreSQL, so I have a better hope of understanding it. The entire database is stored in a single file!

# Sqlite

There's lots of [documentation of sqlite internals](https://www.sqlite.org/arch.html) on their website, plus I've got a copy of [SQLite Database System: Design and Implementation](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9Z6IQQnX1JEC).

{% include image.html url="assets/images/arch1.gif" description="sqlite architecture (https://www.sqlite.org/zipvfs/doc/trunk/www/howitworks.wiki)" %}

A query goes through a chain of components in order to retrieve or modify data. The **front-end** consists of the:
- tokenizer
- parser
- code generator

The input to the front-end is a SQL query. the output is sqlite virtual machine bytecode (essentially a compiled program that can operate on the database).

The _back-end_ consists of the:
- virtual machine
- B-tree
- pager
- os interface

The **virtual machine** takes bytecode generated by the front-end as instructions. It can then perform operations on one or more tables or indexes, each of which is stored in a data structure called a B-tree. The VM is essentially a big switch statement on the type of bytecode instruction.

Each **B-tree** consists of many nodes. Each node is one page in length. The B-tree can retrieve a page from disk or save it back to disk by issuing commands to the pager.

The **pager** receives commands to read or write pages of data. It is responsible for reading/writing at appropriate offsets in the database file. It also keeps a cache of recently-accessed pages in memory, and determines when those pages need to be written back to disk.

The **os interface** is the layer that differs depending on which operating system sqlite was compiled for. In this tutorial, I'm not going to support multiple platforms.

[A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_journey_of_a_thousand_miles_begins_with_a_single_step), so let's start with something a little more straightforward: the REPL.

## Making a Simple REPL

Sqlite starts a read-execute-print loop when you start it from the command line:

```shell
~ sqlite3
SQLite version 3.16.0 2016-11-04 19:09:39
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
sqlite> create table users (id int, username varchar(255), email varchar(255));
sqlite> .tables
users
sqlite> .exit
~
```

To do that, our main function will have an infinite loop that prints the prompt, gets a line of input, then processes that line of input:

```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Main().run();
    }

    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            printPrompt();
            String input = readInput();
            Objects.requireNonNull(input);

            if (input.isEmpty()) {
                continue; // do nothing and loop
            }
            if (input.equals(".exit")) {
                System.out.println("Exiting - Good bye.");
                System.exit(0);
            } else {
                System.out.printf("Unrecognized command: '%s'%n", input);
            }
        }
    }
```


`printPrompt()` prints a prompt to the user. We do this before reading each line of input.

```java
    private void printPrompt() {
        System.out.print("homemadeDB > ");
    }
```

To read a line of input, we use a ([buffered](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html)) [InputStreamReader](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/InputStreamReader.html):


```java
    private String readInput() {
        String inputLine = null;
        try {
            BufferedReader is = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
            inputLine = is.readLine();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("IOException: " + e);
        }
        return inputLine;
    }
```

Finally, we parse and execute the command.
There is only one recognized command right now : `.exit`, which terminates the program. Otherwise we print an error message and continue the loop.
Also, if the input is empty, we loop again.

```java
if (input.equals(".exit")) {
    System.out.println("Exiting - Good bye.");
    System.exit(0);
} else if (input.isEmpty()) {
    // do nothing and loop
} else {
    System.out.println("Unrecognized command.");
}
```

Let's try it out!
```shell
# launch java Main
homemadeDB >  .tables
Unrecognized command: '.tables'
db > .exit
Exiting - Good bye.
~
```

Alright, we've got a working REPL. In the next part, we'll start developing our command language. Meanwhile, here's the entire program from this part:

```java
package org.cyrilou242.homemadedb;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.Objects;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Main().run();
    }

    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            printPrompt();
            String input = readInput();
            Objects.requireNonNull(input);

            if (input.isEmpty()) {
                continue; // do nothing and loop
            }
            if (input.equals(".exit")) {
                System.out.println("Exiting - Good bye.");
                System.exit(0);
            } else {
                System.out.printf("Unrecognized command: '%s'%n", input);
            }
        }
    }

    private void printPrompt() {
        System.out.print("homemadeDB > ");
    }

    private String readInput() {
        String inputLine = null;
        try {
            BufferedReader is = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
            inputLine = is.readLine();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("IOException: " + e);
        }
        return inputLine;
    }
}
```
